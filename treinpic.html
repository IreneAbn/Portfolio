            Treinpic is designed as a combination of hiking and social app,
            heavily based on geotagged photos.

          <p>
            It is a visual guide and a library for hikers as well as a place to

          <p class="body">
            This project was born from all the comments I gathered from hiking
            beginners. Complaints about the difficulty of reading maps outside
            urban areas. The subjectivity of route levels. And the frustration
            when feeling that the views and photos were not worth the effort of
            the hike.
          </p>
          <p class="body">
            There are already many hiking apps in the market, so I was curious
            to understand why people were having these problems. With all this,
            I defined my problem statement:
          </p>
          <p class="cursiva">
            “Hiking beginners need to feel in control in Nature, discover routes
            they like and people that motivate them to keep hiking.”
          </p>
          <p class="body">
            The MVP is the result of the research’s data and user journey study.
            I defined three main areas of focus:
          </p>

        <div class="h2-body">
          <p class="body">
            The major UX challenge in this project was to introduce a social
            aspect within a hiking app, which naturally connects with the
            trail’s geotagged photos. Design how these two parts interact, how
            users can navigate from a social post to starting a route. Define
            the meaning and interactions of the social area so it doesn’t lose
            its focus on sharing knowledge and connecting hikers.
          </p>
          <p class="body2">
            The business strategy was also a challenge. The main user of the app
            is a hiking beginner who is not interested in having to pay anything
            at the moment, but instead finding out what the value is first. I
            had to decide which free features would be enough to give a taste of
            the app and generate engagement. And also which others have a bigger
            value to be available only for Premium users.

            I designed the home screen “Explore” as a classic hiking app screen,
            with suggestions of routes based on the user’s preferences. The
            “Community” screen, is where the user interacts with other hikers.
            They can follow people and see posts with photos divided in four
            categories: Routes, Spots, Places and Hikers. Higher rated posts
            will appear first along with posts from the people the user follows.
            There is a filter with selectable preferences and the option to just
            see routes or posts from the people in the user’s network.

            The monetization of this app is a Premium subscription that allows
            users to publish posts and routes, to DM other hikers through the
            app and to access and creates groups. The app can be used without
            registration to see posts and routes, but only when users do
            register, for free, they can follow routes, save items and record
            new routes for themselves.
          </p>
          <p class="body">
            As next steps I proposed the creation of hiking groups; and a
            variation of that, which is publishing route events that people can
            join. I also proposed a “Wise hiker” badge that will allow expert
            hikers to organize and guide difficult or special routes for a
            price.

            Since geotagged photos were such an important part, I paid special
            attention and spent some time on its design, trying to display them
            seamlessly integrated in the app to accompany and help the user
            visually.

            Performing Usability Testing highlighted some problems such as small
            texts that users had trouble to read and cards too packed with
            information. There was also a potential problem with the route’s
            timer button play/pause/stop, because the instructions added below
            them were not very clear and could lead to misunderstandings.

            The icons and photos were designed so that all could be translated from
            the trail screen to the live route for consistency. On reflection, I
            found in the design a reminiscence of layout and presentation
            designs from my Architecture days.

            I iterated some cards designs in the “Community” categories, keeping

            The route’s timer button play/pause/stop was replaced by two
