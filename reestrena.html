            Reestrena is a small second-hand women's clothes shop located in
            Madrid.
          </p>
          <p>
            The redesign of its website focuses on cultivating customer's trust
            in second-hand online shopping.

            We were a team of 3 (Eduardo, Lara and myself) working on the
            UX and UI redesign. Although I especially focused on Architecture Information and UI Design.

            Our main goal for this redesign was to increase customer‚Äôs trust.
            Based on the research‚Äôs data, customer‚Äôs main concern when buying
            second-hand clothes online were the lack of trust in the photos due
            to their bad quality. We decided to focus on the visual information of the items.
          </p>
          <p class="body2">
            Redesign the information architecture was also key in this project.
            There wasn‚Äôt a clear hierarchy and among other problems, the
            Navigation bar in the home page was hidden behind a banner and a
            payment gateway was half missing.

            I designed a clean Home Screen with two main buttons and a tab bar.
            The ‚ÄúAct‚Äù button was conceived as an SOS button, it is prominent and
            leads the user to a screen with three different activity themes.
            Following the premise of the user's lack of clarity, the app will
            generate a random activity from the chosen theme but letting the
            users decide to carry on, generate another or choose one from the
            library.
          </p>
          <p class="body2">
            The tracking solution: users are asked to add their mood before and
            after the activity along with some notes. All the data is kept and
            easily presented daily, weekly and monthly; for them to check their
            progress and effectiveness of each activity. I tested the screens
            with the higher information load to make sure they were still
            readable.

            One thing I found difficult was to write the copy of the app. I
            tested Low/Mid-Fidelity Prototypes with users and the majority did
            not understand the meaning of the text in the buttons and where they
            would take them.
          </p>
          <p class="body2">
            Also, here was my first real encounter with accessibility. I first
            chose orange as the primary colour for buttons with texts in white
            but all the combinations failed on accessibility tools.
