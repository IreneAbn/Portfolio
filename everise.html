            It helps cultivate self-awareness by tracking what works for the
            user to overcome anxiety and stress, including mindfulness tips to
            encourage the mind to be present.

            Nowadays, stress has become a serious public health challenge in our
            society. Aligned to this wellness topic and after a thorough
            research, I defined the problem statement of my case study to focus
            on self-awareness:
          </p>
          <p class="cursiva">
            ‚ÄúYoung adults that need to discover what works best for them to cope
            with stress and anxiety in the moment or later.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p class="body">
            The MVP is the result of the research‚Äôs data and user journey study.
            I defined three main areas of focus:

            One of the main considerations I took into account when creating the
            information architecture for this app was the emotional state of our
            main user type. When accessing the app the user will often be
            anxious and stressed, without a very clear mind to choose between
            many options. My main goal was to keep a concise and friendly
            interface with a clear user flow.

        <div class="h2-body">
          <p class="body">
            Another key thing was the location and design of the tracking. I had
            to create strategic inputs for the user to get meaningful data, and
            design it so the user could fill it without much effort, which will
            increase its efficiency. The registered data also needed to be
            presented in an easily readable way.

            I designed a clean Home Screen with two main buttons and a tab bar.
            The ‚ÄúAct‚Äù button was conceived as an SOS button, it is prominent and
            leads the user to a screen with three different activity themes.
            Following the premise of the user's lack of clarity, the app will
            generate a random activity from the chosen theme but letting the
            users decide to carry on, generate another or choose one from the
            library.
          </p>
          <p class="body2">
            The tracking solution: users are asked to add their mood before and
            after the activity along with some notes. All the data is kept and
            easily presented daily, weekly and monthly; for them to check their
            progress and effectiveness of each activity. I tested the screens
            with the higher information load to make sure they were still
            readable.

            One thing I found difficult was to write the copy of the app. I
            tested Low/Mid-Fidelity Prototypes with users and the majority did
            not understand the meaning of the text in the buttons and where they
            would take them.
          </p>
          <p class="body2">
            Also, here was my first real encounter with accessibility. I first
            chose orange as the primary colour for buttons with texts in white
            but all the combinations failed on accessibility tools.

        <div class="h2-body">
          <p class="body">
            I had to iterate a few times the copys of the buttons, test them
            with users which resulted in adding some instructions in the home
            screen.
          </p>
          <p class="body2">
            To solve the accessibility issue I decided to switch colours and use
            the blue tone as the primary colour. When I tested the colours in
            the High Fidelity Mockups I realized that both will have to be used
            to create an opposition, so users could understand the before and
            after information in the charts easily.
